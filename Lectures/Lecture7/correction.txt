1. The type of P should be revised as follows:

P : Label x DistConst -> DistConst x Value^*

2. I used the addition of two sequences. When the sequences have different lengths,
their addition should be understood as the following two-step process. First, we
extend a shorter sequence by adding 0 so that both sequences have the same length.
Next, we add these sequences of the same length.

3. In the third handwritten note, the weight update should be

w x p0/q0

instead of w x q0/p0.

4. Also, the updated gradient in the step (c) of the top-level algorithm should be

g' + eta x 1/K x sum_{k=1}^K (log w_k) x G_k(alpha,d).

Note that the (log w_k) term is inserted in the formula.
